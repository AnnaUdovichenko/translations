This tutorial introduces you to the basic concepts of FParsec. 

Our goal is to give you an intuition for how you can build parser applications using the FParsec library. We will only cover the basic ideas and only cursorily explore FParsec’s API, but hopefully we will cover enough ground to enable you to further explore FParsec with the help of the [user’s guide](http://www.quanttec.com/fparsec/users-guide/), the [API reference](http://www.quanttec.com/fparsec/reference/) and the sample parsers in the Samples folder.
